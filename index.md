    <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. I am a researcher and aspiring clinical psychologist focused on suicide prevention and mental health, with a particular interest in how suicide risk changes during periods of behavior change and psychological transition. My work examines fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and related experiences over time, especially during moments when individuals are trying to change long-standing patterns of behavior or coping.

This site provides an overview of my academic and professional work, including my curriculum vitae, research posters, and ongoing projects. It also serves as a space to share collaborations and make my work in psychology and neuroscience accessible.</p>
