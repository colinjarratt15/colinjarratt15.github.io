       Hello, and welcome to my website. I am a researcher and aspiring clinical psychologist focused on suicide prevention and mental health. I graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse University in 2025 with a B.S. in Neuroscience and Psychology. My work centers on how suicide risk changes during periods of behavior change and psychological transition, and examines fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and related experiences over time, particularly when individuals are attempting to change long-standing patterns of behavior or coping.
